{"name":"Tetris","tagline":"in Java","body":"I followed the tutorial from here:\r\n[http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/tetris/](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/tetris/)\r\n\r\nTo play the game, run Tetris.java\r\n\r\n**Why did I pick that tutorial?**\r\nI was using Java (and started to learn it as well) this semester for my programming module. Since I would like to make some games, I was looking for making something graphical in Java. I thought it would be hard since I always use Eclipse IDE and I don't think it would support making a graphic output like HTML5 Canvas. So I tried looking for simple game (not like those current console and PC games) in Java, and that's when I found the tutorial. It was interesting, learning Java Swing, though in the end I matched my code with the given code (I retyped the code and tried to optimised here and there, but in the end it didn't work, so I matched back).\r\n\r\n_*This page is not complete yet. Still some stuff to add-on._\r\n_*I am still figuring out how to deploy Java in the Web, so for the time being, if you would like to try the game, you could remake the whole thing from the tutorial, or fork my repo. Have fun!_\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
